This Azure Developer CLI (azd) template provides a streamlined way to provision and deploy Azure AI Foundry resources for building and running AI agents. It includes infrastructure-as-code definitions and sample application code to help you quickly get started with Azure AI Foundry's agent capabilities, including model deployments, workspace configuration, and supporting services like storage and container hosting.

## Important Security Notice

This template, the application code and configuration it contains, has been built to showcase Microsoft Azure specific services and tools. We strongly advise our customers not to make this code part of their production environments without implementing or enabling additional security features.  

## Features

This architecture shows how the Azure AI Foundry starter template creates a complete environment for AI agent development and deployment, with optional components that can be enabled based on your needs.

## Getting Started

### GitHub Codespaces

> üöß **Work in Progress** - GitHub Codespaces setup is currently being developed and will be available soon.

### VS Code Dev Containers

> üöß **Work in Progress** - VS Code Dev Containers configuration is currently being developed and will be available soon.

### Local Environment

Note: this repository is not meant to be cloned, but to be consumed as a template in your own project.

#### Prerequisites

* Install [azd](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
  * Windows: `winget install microsoft.azd`
  * Linux: `curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash`
  * MacOS: `brew tap azure/azd && brew install azd`

#### Quickstart

1. Bring down the template code:

    ```shell
    azd init --template Azure-Samples/ai-foundry-starter-basic
    ```

    This will perform a git clone

2. Sign into your Azure account:

    ```shell
     azd auth login
    ```

3. Add an agent... üöß **Work in Progress**

## Guidance

### Region Availability

This template does not use specific models. The model deployments are a parameter of the template. Each model may not be available in all Azure regions. Check for [up-to-date region availability of Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/reference/region-support) and in particular the [Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/model-region-support?tabs=global-standard).

## Resource Clean-up

To prevent incurring unnecessary charges, it's important to clean up your Azure resources after completing your work with the application.

- **When to Clean Up:**
  - After you have finished testing or demonstrating the application.
  - If the application is no longer needed or you have transitioned to a different project or environment.
  - When you have completed development and are ready to decommission the application.

- **Deleting Resources:**
  To delete all associated resources and shut down the application, execute the following command:
  
    ```bash
    azd down
    ```

    Please note that this process may take up to 20 minutes to complete.

‚ö†Ô∏è Alternatively, you can delete the resource group directly from the Azure Portal to clean up resources.

### Costs

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers.

You can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) for the resources deployed in this template.

‚ö†Ô∏è To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use, either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Security guidelines

This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

- Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/).
- Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
